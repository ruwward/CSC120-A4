Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
encapsulation keeps sections of the program from each other, which was a little weird to get used to because I was so used to directly modifying objects, but after a little while it made sense and i started putting together how it helps code better reflect the real world

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
tbh the thing that was msot problematic was i kept getting a configuration error bug but eventually i got that fixed by going to office hours
definitley use oracle as much as possible it was super helpful to figure out what methods already existed
